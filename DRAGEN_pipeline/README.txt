DRAGEN joint genotyping — Workflow

The DRAGEN joint genotyping workflow consists of six sequential processing steps that convert sample-level gVCF files into chromosome-wise multi-sample VCFs.

Step 1 — Aggregate gVCF Files (step1_igg.sh): All DRAGEN-generated gVCF files from individual samples are collected and organized for joint processing.

Step 2 — Aggregate Census Files (step2_igg.sh): DRAGEN census files, which contain site-level detailed, are aggregated across all samples to ensure consistent variant confidence and filtering.

Step 3 — Generate MSVCF (step3_igg.sh): Multi-sample VCF (MSVCF) files are generated by jointly genotyping samples over genome shards.

Step 4 — Merge MSVCF per Genome Shard (step4_igg.sh): All shard-level MSVCFs are merged to create genome-wide intermediate MSVCFs.

Step 5 — Concatenate MSVCF per Batch (step5_igg.sh): MSVCFs produced from different computational batches are concatenated to form complete multi-sample variant sets.

Step 6 — Merge MSVCF per Chromosome (step6_igg.sh): Final chromosome-wise MSVCF files (e.g., chr1, chr2, … chr22, chrX, chrY, chrM) are produced for downstream variant filtering, annotation, and analysis.
