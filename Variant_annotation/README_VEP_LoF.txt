A Python automation pipeline to run Ensembl VEP with LOFTEE plugins, and parse results into a custom-delimited CSV format.What this script does:¥ Annotates: Runs the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) on an unzipped vcf file using a local cache and the LOFTEE plugin for high-confidence Loss-of-Function prediction.Converts: Transforms complex VCF INFO fields into a flattened CSV format (using ~ as a delimiter) for easier downstream analysis.
